        <p>Dear Ramya,</p>
         <p>I'm not the best at writing messages, and this may be too much for *just* a one-month anniversary, but here goes:</p>
        <p>It's only been a month, but it feels like it's been so much longer. I am so grateful that we met all those years ago, at HBSCE, and more so that you chose to become friends with me. My life is so much better, and so much more beautiful with you in it. I hope that one of these days, you realise just how special you are.</p>
        <p>I have a lot more to say, but I think I will save it for the years ahead.</p>
        <p>See you soon.
          I love you.
        </p>
        <p>Come watch the stars with me.</p>
        <p></p>
